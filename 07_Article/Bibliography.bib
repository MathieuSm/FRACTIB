    abstract = {Motivated by the mechanical analysis of multiphase or damaged materials, a general approach relating fabric tensors characterizing microstructure to the fourth rank elasticity tensor is proposed. Using a Fourier expansion in spherical harmonics, the orientation distribution function of a positive, radially symmetric microstructural property is approximated by a scalar and a symmetric, traceless second rank tensor. Following this approximation, a general expression of the elastic free energy potential is derived from representation theorems for anisotropic scalar functions. Based on a homogeneity assumption for the elastic constitutive law with respect to the microstructural property, a particular elasticity model is developed that involves three independent constants beside the fabric tensors. Strict positive definiteness of the corresponding elasticity tensor is ensured under explicit conditions on the independent constants for arbitrary fabric tensors. {\textcopyright}1995.},

abstract = {Introduction: Micro finite element analysis ($\mu$FE) is a widely applied tool in biomedical research for assessing in vivo mechanical properties of bone at measurement sites, including the ultra-distal radius and tibia. A finite element approach (hFE) based on homogenized constitutive models for trabecular bone offers an attractive alternative for clinical use, as it is computationally less expensive than traditional $\mu$FE. The respective patient-specific models for in vivo bone strength estimation are usually based on standard clinical high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) measurements. They include a scan region of roughly 10 mm in height and are referred to as single-sections. It has been shown, that these small peripheral bone sections don't reliably cover the fracture line in Colles' fractures and therefore the weakest region at the radius. Recently introduced multiple section (multiple adjacent single-sections) measurements might improve the evaluation of bone strength, but little is known about the repeatability of hFE estimations in general, and especially for multiple section measurement protocols. Accordingly, the aim of the present work is to quantify repeatability of clinical in vivo bone strength measurement by hFE on multiple section HR-pQCT reconstructions at the distal radius and tibia. Methods: Nineteen healthy Swiss women (43.6y ± 17.8y) and twenty men (48.2y ± 19.4y) were examined with HR-pQCT at 61 $\mu$m isotropic voxel resolution. Each subject was first scanned three times using a double-section (336 slices) at the distal radius and then three times using a triple-section (504 slices) at the distal tibia. The multiple section HR-pQCT reconstructions were graded for motion artefacts and non-linear hFE models (radius and tibia) and linear $\mu$FE models (only radius) were generated for estimation of stiffness and ultimate load. Then in vivo repeatability errors were computed in terms of root mean square coefficients of variation (CV). Results: In vivo repeatability errors of non-linear hFE stiffness (S) and ultimate load (F) were significantly higher at the radius (S: 2.71% and F: 2.97%) compared to the tibia (S: 1.21%, F: 1.45%). Multiple section linear $\mu$FE at the radius resulted in substantially higher repeatability errors (S: 5.38% and F: 10.80%) compared to hFE. Discussion/conclusion: Repeatability errors of hFE outcomes based on multiple section measurements at the distal radius and tibia were generally lower compared to respective reported single-section $\mu$FE repeatability errors. Therefore, hFE is an attractive alternative to today's gold standard of $\mu$FE models and should especially be encouraged when analyzing multiple section measurements.},

abstract = {Introduction: The application of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to assess bone microarchitecture has grown rapidly since its introduction in 2005. As the use of HR-pQCT for clinical research continues to grow, there is an urgent need to form a consensus on imaging and analysis methodologies so that studies can be appropriately compared. In addition, with the recent introduction of the second-generation HrpQCT, which differs from the first-generation HR-pQCT in scan region, resolution, and morphological measurement techniques, there is a need for guidelines on appropriate reporting of results and considerations as the field adopts newer systems. Methods: A joint working group between the International Osteoporosis Foundation, American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, and European Calcified Tissue Society convened in person and by teleconference over several years to produce the guidelines and recommendations presented in this document. Results: An overview and discussion is provided for (1) standardized protocol for imaging distal radius and tibia sites using HR-pQCT, with the importance of quality control and operator training discussed; (2) standardized terminology and recommendations on reporting results; (3) factors influencing accuracy and precision error, with considerations for longitudinal and multi-center study designs; and finally (4) comparison between scanner generations and other high-resolution CT systems. Conclusion: This article addresses the need for standardization of HR-pQCT imaging techniques and terminology, provides guidance on interpretation and reporting of results, and discusses unresolved issues in the field.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of human trabecular bone play an important role in age-related bone fragility and implant stability. Microfinite element (lFE) analysis allows computing the apparent elastic properties of trabecular bone for use in homogenized FE (hFE) analysis, but the results depend unfortunately on the type of applied boundary conditions (BCs). In this study, 167 human femoral trabecular cubic regions with a side length of 5.3mm were extracted from three proximal femora and analyzed using lFE analysis to compare systematically their stiffness with kinematic uniform BCs (KUBCs) and periodicity-compatible mixed uniform BCs (PMUBCs). The obtained elastic constants were then used in the volume fraction and fabric-based orthotropic Zysset-Curnier model to identify their respective model parameters. As expected, PMUBCs lead to more compliant apparent elastic properties than KUBCs, especially in shear. The differences in stiffness decreased with bone volume fraction and mean intercept length (MIL). Unlike KUBCs, PMUBCs were sensitive to heterogeneity of the biopsies. The Zysset-Curnier model fitted the apparent elastic constants successfully in both cases with adjusted coefficients of determination (r2adj) of 0.986 for KUBCs and 0.975 for PMUBCs. The proper use of these BCs for hFE analysis of whole bones will need to be investigated in future work.},

Samples too small to be representative appear stiffer under kinematic uniform BCs (KUBCs) than under periodicity-compatible mixed uniform BCs (PMUBCs). To avoid those effects, we propose to determine the effective properties of trabecular bone using an embedded configuration. Cubic samples of various sizes (2.63, 5.29, 7.96, 10.58 and 15.87 mm) were cropped from $\mu$CT scans of femoral heads and vertebral bodies. They were converted into $\mu$FE models and their stiffness tensor was established via six uniaxial and shear load cases. PMUBCs- and KUBCs-based tensors were determined for each sample. “In situ” stiffness tensors were also evaluated for the embedded configuration, i.e. when the loads were transmitted to the samples via a layer of trabecular bone. The Zysset–Curnier model accounting for bone volume fraction and fabric anisotropy was fitted to those stiffness tensors, and model parameters $\nu$0 (Poisson's ratio) E0 and $\mu$0 (elastic and shear moduli) were compared between sizes. BCs and sample size had little impact on $\nu$0. However, KUBCs- and PMUBCs-based E0 and $\mu$0, respectively, decreased and increased with growing size, though convergence was not reached even for our largest samples. Both BCs produced upper and lower bounds for the in situ values that were almost constant across samples dimensions, thus appearing as an approximation of the effective properties. PMUBCs seem also appropriate for mimicking the trabecular core, but they still underestimate its elastic properties (especially in shear) even for nearly orthotropic samples.},

On considère un milieu dans lequel la déformation plastique s'effectue par glissements suivant plusieurs familles de plans parallèles, ou plus généralement met en jeu simultanément plusieurs mécanismes. Un tel cas a déjà été envisagé par différents auteurs (Budiansky [1], Sanders [7], Koiter [4]), mais seulement dans l'hypothèse de mécanismes indépendants. Koiter a, dans une synthèse d'une grande élégance [4], étendu la théorie classique de la plasticité au cas oú il existe plusieurs mécanismes d'écoulement indépendants. La généralisation que nous envisageons ici concerne le cas de mécanismes d'écoulement non indépendants. Un glissement suivant une première direction, par exemple, influe sur la résistance au glissement suivant une autre direction. Nous établissons d'abord et discutons la forme des relations d'écoulement correspondant à ce cas. Nous montrons ensuite que ces relations plus générales conservent les mêmes propriétés que celles de Koiter, moyennant deux hypothèses complémentaires qui permettent de retrouver tous les théorèmes de la théorie du potentiel plastique.
A medium is considered in which plastic deformation is induced simultaneously by several mechanisms. Such a scheme has already been proposed by different authors, notably Koiter, but assuming only independent mechanisms. The generalization considered here is concerned with the case of non-independent mechanisms. First the flow relations are established and their form discussed. It is shown next, with the aid of two complementary hypotheses, that these more general relations retain the same properties as those of Koiter. In conclusion, it is shown that these two hypotheses permit the finding of all the classical theorems of the theory of the plastic potential, as well as the properties of waves and surfaces of discontinuity established before for the case of a simple plastic potential.

abstract = {As our population ages, more individuals suffer from osteoporosis. This disease leads to impaired trabecular architecture and increased fracture risk. It is essential to understand how morphological and mechanical properties of the cancellous bone are related. Morphology-elasticity relationships based on bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and fabric anisotropy explain up to 98% of the variation in elastic properties. Yet, other morphological variables such as individual trabeculae segmentation (ITS) and trabecular bone score (TBS) could improve the stiffness predictions. A total of 743 micro-computed tomography ($\mu$CT) reconstructions of cubic trabecular bone samples extracted from femur, radius, vertebrae, and iliac crest were analyzed. Their morphology was assessed via 25 variables and their stiffness tensor (CFE) was computed from six independent load cases using micro finite element ($\mu$FE) analyses. Variance inflation factors were calculated to evaluate collinearity between morphological variables and decide upon their inclusion in morphology-elasticity relationships. The statistically admissible morphological variables were included in a multiple linear regression model of the dependent variable CFE. The contribution of each independent variable was evaluated (ANOVA). Our results show that BV/TV is the best determinant of CFE(r2adj = 0.889), especially in combination with fabric anisotropy (r2adj = 0.968). Including the other independent predictors hardly affected the amount of variance explained by the model (r2adj = 0.975). Across all anatomical sites, BV/TV explained 87% of the variance of the bone elastic properties. Fabric anisotropy further described 10% of the bone stiffness, but the improvement in variance explanation by adding other independent factors was marginal (<1%). These findings confirm that BV/TV and fabric anisotropy are the best determinants of trabecular bone stiffness and show, against common belief, that other morphological variables do not bring any further contribution. These overall conclusions remain to be confirmed for specific bone diseases and postelastic properties.},

abstract = {Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary disorder characterized by decreased biosynthesis or impaired morphology of type I collagen that leads to decreased bone mass and increased bone fragility. We hypothesized that patients with OI have altered bone microstructure and bone geometry. In this cross-sectional study we compared patients with type I OI to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. A total of 39 (13 men and 26 women) patients with OI, aged 53 (range, 21-77) years, and 39 controls, aged 53 (range, 21-77) years, were included in the study. Twenty-seven of the patients had been treated with bisphosphonates. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at the distal radius and distal tibia and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of total hip, femoral neck, trochanteric region, and the lumbar spine (L1-L4) were performed. The patients were shorter than the controls (159 ± 10 cm versus 170 ± 9 cm, p < 0.001), but had similar body weight. In OI, areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was 8% lower at the hip (p < 0.05) and 13% lower at the spine (p < 0.001) compared with controls. The trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) was 28% lower in radius (p < 0.001) and 38% lower in tibia (p < 0.001) in OI compared with controls. At radius, total bone area was 5% lower in OI than in controls (p < 0.05). In the tibia, cortical bone area was 18% lower in OI (p < 0.001). In both radius and tibia the number of trabeculae was lower in patients compared to the controls (35% and 38%, respectively, p < 0.001 at both sites). Furthermore, trabecular spacing was 55% higher in OI in both tibia and radius (p < 0.001 at both sites) when compared with controls. We conclude that patients with type I OI have lower aBMD, vBMD, bone area, and trabecular number when compared with healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

abstract = {Summary: Bone microarchitecture by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) was assessed in adult patients with mild, moderate, and severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The trabecular bone score (TBS), bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and dual X-ray and laser (DXL) at the calcaneus were likewise assessed in patients with OI. Trabecular microstructure and BMD in particular were severely altered in patients with OI. Introduction: OI is characterized by high fracture risk but not necessarily by low BMD. The main purpose of this study was to assess bone microarchitecture and BMD at different skeletal sites in different types of OI. Methods: HR-pQCT was performed in 30 patients with OI (mild OI-I, n = 18 (41.8 [34.7, 55.7] years) and moderate to severe OI-III-IV, n = 12 (47.6 [35.3, 58.4] years)) and 30 healthy age-matched controls. TBS, BMD by DXA at the lumbar spine and hip, as well as BMD by DXL at the calcaneus were likewise assessed in patients with OI only. Results: At the radius, significantly lower trabecular parameters including BV/TV (p = 0.01 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and trabecular number (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) as well as an increased inhomogeneity of the trabecular network (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) were observed in OI-I and OI-III-IV in comparison to the control group. Similar results for trabecular parameters were found at the tibia. Microstructural parameters were worse in OI-III-IV than in OI-I. No significant differences were found in cortical thickness and cortical porosity between the three subgroups at the radius. The cortical thickness of the tibia was thinner in OI-I (p < 0.001), but not OI-III-IV, when compared to controls. Conclusions: Trabecular BMD and trabecular bone microstructure in particular are severely altered in patients with clinical OI-I and OI-III-IV. Low TBS and DXL and their significant associations to HR-pQCT parameters of trabecular bone support this conclusion.},

Skeletal assessment included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), and bone turnover serum analyses. Bone microstructure of 21/29 OI patients was assessed and compared to 23 age- and sex-matched patients clinically classified EOOP but without mutations in the known disease genes as well as to 20 healthy controls. In the OI patients, we did not observe an age-dependent decrease in DXA Z-scores. HR-pQCT revealed a significant reduction in volumetric BMD and microstructural parameters in the distal radius and tibia in both the OI and EOOP cohorts compared to the healthy controls. When comparing the bone microstructure of OI patients with the EOOP cohort, significant differences were found in terms of bone geometry in the radius, while no significant changes were detected in all other HR-pQCT parameters at the radius and tibia. Taken together, adult mild OI patients demonstrate a predominantly high bone turnover trabecular bone loss syndrome that shows minor microstructural differences compared to EOOP without mutation detection.},

abstract = {Summary: Bone strength is dependent on bone density and microstructure. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) can measure microstructure but is somewhat limited due to its resolution. We compared a new HR-pQCT scanner to existing technology and found very good agreement for most parameters. This study will be important when interpreting results from different devices. Introduction: Recently, a second-generation HR-pQCT scanner (XCT2) has been developed with a higher nominal isotropic resolution (61 $\mu$m) compared to the first-generation device (XCT1, 82 $\mu$m). It is unclear how in vivo measurements from these two devices compare. In this study, we obtained and analyzed in vivo XCT1 and XCT2 measurements of bone microarchitecture and estimated strength. Methods: We scanned 51 adults (16 men and 35 women, age 44.8 ± 16.0) on both XCT2 and XCT1 on the same day. We first compared XCT1 and XCT2 measurements obtained using their respective standard patient protocols. In XCT1, microarchitecture parameters were derived, while XCT2 measurements were directly measured. We also compared XCT2-D with XCT1 by finding the overlapping regions of interest and using the standard patient protocol for XCT1. Results: We obtained excellent agreement between XCT1 and XCT2 for most of the volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), trabecular and cortical measurements (All R2 > 0.820) except for cortical porosity at the radius (R2 = 0.638), trabecular number (R2 = 0.694, 0.787) and trabecular thickness (R2 = 0.569, 0.527) at both radius and tibia, respectively. XCT1 and XCT2-D measurements also had excellent agreement for most of the measurements (all R2 > 0.870) except trabecular number (R2 = 0.524, 0.706), trabecular thickness (R2 = 0.758, 0.734) at both radius and tibia, respectively, and trabecular separation (R2 = 0.656) at the radius. Conclusion: While some caution should be exercised for parameters that are more dependent on image resolution, results from our study indicate that second-generation scans can be compared to more widely available first-generation data and may be beneficial for multicenter and longitudinal studies using both scanner generations.},

abstract = {Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is the most common inherited form of bone fragility and includes a heterogenous group of genetic disorders which most commonly result from defects associated with type 1 collagen. 85%–90% of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and are caused by mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, leading to quantitative or qualitative defects in type 1 collagen. In the last decade, defects in several other proteins involved in the normal processing of type 1 collagen have been described. Recent advances in genetics have called for reconsideration of the classification of OI, however, most recent classifications align with the classic clinical classification by Sillence. The hallmark of the disease is bone fragility but other tissues are also affected. Intravenous bisphosphonates (BPs) are the most widely used intervention, having significant favorable effects regarding areal bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral reshaping following fractures in growing children. BPs have a modest effect in long bone fracture incidence, their effects in adults with OI concerns only BMD, while there are reports of subtrochanteric fractures resembling atypical femoral fractures. Other therapies showing promising results include denosumab, teriparatide, sclerostin inhibition, combination therapy with antiresorptive and anabolic drugs and TGF-$\beta$ inhibition. Gene targeting approaches are under evaluation. More research is needed to delineate the best therapeutic approach in this heterogeneous disease.},

There are no comprehensive genotype-phenotype studies on >100 families outside North America, and no population-based studies determining the genetic epidemiology of OI. Here, detailed clinical phenotypes were recorded, and the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes were analyzed in 164 Swedish OI families (223 individuals). Averages for bone mineral density (BMD), height and yearly fracture rate were calculated and related to OI and mutation type. N-terminal helical mutations in both the $\alpha$1-and $\alpha$2-chains were associated with the absence of dentinogenesis imperfecta (P<0.0001 vs 0.0049), while only those in the $\alpha$1-chain were associated with blue sclera (P=0.0110). Comparing glycine with serine substitutions, $\alpha$1-alterations were associated with more severe phenotype (P=0.0031). Individuals with type I OI caused by qualitative vs quantitative mutations were shorter (P<0.0001), but did not differ considering fractures or BMD. The children in this cohort were estimated to represent >95% of the complete Swedish pediatric OI population. The prevalence of OI types I, III, and IV was 5.16, 0.89, and 1.35/100 000, respectively (7.40/100 000 overall), corresponding to what has been estimated but not unequivocally proven in any population. Collagen I mutation analysis was performed in the family of 97% of known cases, with causative mutations found in 87%. Qualitative mutations caused 32% of OI type I. The data reported here may be helpful to predict phenotype, and describes for the first time the genetic epidemiology in >95% of an entire OI population.},

The predominant cause of OI is due to mutations in the two genes that encode type I collagen. However, recent advances in sequencing technology has led to the discovery of novel genes that are implicated in recessive and dominant OI. These include genes that regulate the post-translational modification, secretion and processing of type I collagen as well as those required for osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization. As such, OI has become a spectrum of genetic disorders informing about the determinants of both bone quantity and quality. Here we summarize the known genetic causes of OI, animal models that recapitulate the human disease and mechanisms that underlie disease pathogenesis. Additionally, we discuss the effects of disrupted collagen networks on extracellular matrix signaling and its impact on disease progression.}

abstract = {Context: Assessment of trabecular microarchitecture may enhance the prediction of fracture risk and improve monitoring of treatment response. A new high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) system permits in vivo assessment of trabecular architecture and volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) at the distal radius and tibia with a voxel size of 82 $\mu$m3. Objective and Patients: We determined the short-term reproducibility of this device by measuring 15 healthy volunteers three times each. We compared HR-pQCT measurements in 108 healthy premenopausal, 113 postmenopausal osteopenic, and 35 postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Furthermore, we compared values in postmenopausal osteopenic women with (n = 35) and without previous fracture history (n = 78). Design and Setting: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a private clinical research center. Intervention and Main Outcome Measure: We took HR-pQCT measurements of the radius and tibia. Femoral neck and spine BMD were measured in postmenopausal women by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Results: Precision of HR-pQCT measurements was 0.7-1.5% for total, trabecular, and cortical densities and 2.5-4.4% for trabecular architecture. Postmenopausal women had lower density, trabecular number, and cortical thickness than premenopausal women (P < 0.001) at both radius and tibia. Osteoporotic women had lower density, cortical thickness, and increased trabecular separation than osteopenic women (P < 0.01) at both sites. Furthermore, although spine and hip BMD were similar, fractured osteopenic women had lower trabecular density and more heterogeneous trabecular distribution (P < 0.02) at the radius compared with unfractured osteopenic women. Conclusion: HR-pQCT appears promising to assess bone density and microarchitecture at peripheral sites in terms of reproducibility and ability to detect age- and disease-related changes.

abstract = {BMD, bone microarchitecture, and bone mechanical properties assessed in vivo by finite element analysis were associated with wrist fracture in postmenopausal women. Introduction: Many fractures occur in individuals with normal BMD. Assessment of bone mechanical properties by finite element analysis (FEA) may improve identification of those at high risk for fracture. Materials and Methods: We used HR-pQCT to assess volumetric bone density, microarchitecture, and $\mu$FE-derived bone mechanical properties at the radius in 33 postmenopausal women with a prior history of fragility wrist fracture and 33 age-matched controls from the OFELY cohort. Radius areal BMD (aBMD) was also measured by DXA. Associations between density, microarchitecture, mechanical parameters and fracture status were evaluated by univariate logistic regression analysis and expressed as ORs (with 95% CIs) per SD change. We also conducted a principal components (PCs) analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of parameters and study their association (OR) with wrist fracture. Results: Areal and volumetric densities, cortical thickness, trabecular number, and mechanical parameters such as estimated failure load, stiffness, and the proportion of load carried by the trabecular bone at the distal and proximal sites were associated with wrist fracture (p < 0.05). The PCA revealed five independent components that jointly explained 86.2% of the total variability of bone characteristics. The first PC included FE-estimated failure load, areal and volumetric BMD, and cortical thickness, explaining 51% of the variance with an OR for wrist fracture = 2.49 (95% CI, 1.32-4.72). Remaining PCs did not include any density parameters. The second PC included trabecular architecture, explaining 12% of the variance, with an OR = 1.82 (95% CI, 0.94-3.52). The third PC included the proportion of the load carried by cortical versus trabecular bone, assessed by FEA, explaining 9% of the variance, and had an OR = 1.61 (95% CI, 0.94-2.77). Thus, the proportion of load carried by cortical versus trabecular bone seems to be associated with wrist fracture independently of BMD and microarchitecture (included in the first and second PC, respectively). Conclusions: These results suggest that bone mechanical properties assessed by $\mu$FE may provide information about skeletal fragility and fracture risk not assessed by BMD or architecture measurements alone and are therefore likely to enhance the prediction of wrist fracture risk. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

abstract = {Continuum finite element ({FE)} models are standard tools for determination of biomechanical properties of bones and bone-implant systems. This study investigates the accuracy of an enhanced continuum {FE} model by taking u {FE} as the gold standard. The enhanced continuum models account for trabecular bone morphology (density and fabric) as well as for an anatomically correct cortical shell. Vertebral body slice models are extracted from high-resolution {CT} images using an algorithm proposed in [Pahr and Zysset, 2008b. From high-resolution {CT} data to {FE} models: development of an integrated modular framework. Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering, in press.]. Three different models are generated: the proposed enhanced density-fabric-based model with a subject-specific cortex and two classical isotropic density-only models, with and without explicit modeling of the cortical shell. The material property errors of the used morphology-elasticity relationship are minimized by using elasticity tensors from 60 cubical u {FE} models which are cropped from the trabecular centrums of the investigated vertebral bodies. Two different boundary conditions—kinematic [Van Rietbergen et al., 1995. A new method to determine trabecular bone elastic properties and loading using micromechanical {FE} models. Journal of Biomechanics 28 (1), 69–81] and mixed [Pahr, {D.H.}, Zysset, {P.K.}, 2008a. Influence of boundary conditions on computed apparent elastic properties of cancellous bone. Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology 7, 463–476.]—are used in these {FE} models. After removal of the endplates, compressive and antero–posterior shear loading is applied on the investigated vertebral bodies. Individual error sources are studied in more detail by loading also the trabecular centrum (removed shell) and the cortical shell alone. It is found that the cortex-only models need a correction of the shell thickness when transforming from a voxel to a smooth description. The trabecular centrum alone gives too stiff and too soft a response using material calibration with kinematic and mixed boundary conditions, respectively. A comparison of the whole vertebral body stiffnesses shows that an orthotropic cancellous bone material calibrated with kinematic boundary conditions corresponds best with u {FE} . Taken together, the proposed enhanced homogenized surface-based {FE} model is structurally more accurate than density-only models.},

abstract = {Osteoporotic (Colles' type) fractures of the distal radius occur relatively early in lifetime and could estimate risk of fracture of other, more endangered anatomical sites. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) based micro finite element ($\mu$FE) analysis was shown to better predict fracture load of the distal radius than densitometry or histomorphometric measures. As an alternative to $\mu$FE, homogenization-based FE (hFE) approach may provide at least equivalent predictive power with reduced computational needs. The aim of this study was to validate the hFE approach with compression tests of 25 distal radius sections extracted at the location which is relevant in Colles' fractures. HR-pQCT-based input parameters of the hFE models were calibrated with respect to $\mu$CT. HR-pQCT-based hFE models were then built and their ability to predict experimental stiffness and ultimate load was compared to those of the density-based parameters, histomorphometric indices and $\mu$FE models assessed from the same input images. Bone mineral content was the best non-FE-based predictor (R2 = 0.86) of ultimate force. Both FE methods were not only the strongest predictors, but provided quantitatively correct fracture loads. The calibrated hFE approach provided closely as strong prediction (R2 = 0.94) as $\mu$FE (R2 = 0.95), but the former was computationally cheaper. The results of this validation study suggest that FE simulation could be used as an efficient and precise tool to predict Colles' fracture load. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract = {Summary: This study developed a well-standardized and reproducible approach for micro-finite element (mFE) and homogenized-FE (hFE) analyses that can accurately predict the distal radius failure load using either mFE or hFE models when using the approaches and parameters developed in this study. Introduction: Micro-FE analyses based on high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) images are frequently used to predict distal radius failure load. With the introduction of a second-generation HR-pQCT device, however, the default modelling approach no longer provides accurate results. The aim of this study was to develop a well-standardized and reproducible approach for mFE and hFE analyses that can provide precise and accurate results for distal radius failure load predictions based on second-generation HR-pQCT images. Methods: Second-generation HR-pQCT was used to scan the distal 20-mm section of 22 cadaver radii. The sections were excised and mechanically tested afterwards. For these sections, mFE and hFE models were made that were used to identify required material parameters by comparing predicted and measured results. Using these parameters, the models were cropped to represent the 10-mm region recommended for clinical studies to test their performance for failure load prediction. Results: After identification of material parameters, the measured failure load of the 20-mm segments was in good agreement with the results of mFE models (R2 = 0.969, slope = 1.035) and hFE models (R2 = 0.966, slope = 0.890). When the models were restricted to the clinical region, mFE still accurately predicted the measured failure load (R2 = 0.955, slope = 1.021), while hFE predictions were precise but tended to overpredict the failure load (R2 = 0.952, slope = 0.780). Conclusions: It was concluded that it is possible to accurately predict the distal radius failure load using either mFE or hFE models when using the approaches and parameters developed in this study.},

Fabric tensors aim at modeling through tensors both anisotropy and orientation of a material with respect to another one. Fabric tensors are widely used in fields such as trabecular bone research, mechanics of materials and geology. These tensors can be seen as semi-global measurements since they are computed in relatively large neighborhoods, which are assumed quasi-homogeneous. Many methods have been proposed to compute fabric tensors. We propose to classify fabric tensors into two categories: mechanics-based and morphology-based. The former computes fabric tensors from mechanical simulations, while the latter computes them by analyzing the morphology of the materials. In addition to pointing out advantages and drawbacks for each method, current trends and challenges in this field are also summarized.},

Assuming isotropic elastic properties for the trabecular tissue, the general elastic tensors of the bone specimens were determined using the homogenization method and the closest orthotropic tensors were calculated with an optimization algorithm. The assumption of orthotropy for trabecular bone was found to improve with specimen size and hold within 6.1 percent for a 4 mm cube size. A strong global relationship (r2 = 0.95) was obtained between fabric and the orthotropic elastic tensor with a minimal set of five constants. Mean intercept length and average bone length provided an equivalent power of prediction. These results support the hypothesis that the elastic properties of human trabecular bone from an arbitrary anatomical location can be estimated from an approximation of the anisotropic morphology and a prior knowledge of tissue properties. {\textcopyright} 1998 by ASME.},

abstract = {Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an inheritable, genetic, and collagen-related disorder leading to an increase in bone fragility, but the origin of its “brittle behavior” is unclear. Because of its complex hierarchical structure, bone behaves differently at various length scales. This study aims to compare mechanical properties of human OI bone with healthy control bone at the extracellular matrix (ECM) level and to quantify the influence of the degree of mineralization. Degree of mineralization and mechanical properties were analyzed under dry conditions in 12 fixed and embedded transiliac crest biopsies (control n = 6, OI type I n = 3, OI type IV n = 2, and OI type III n = 1). Mean degree of mineralization was measured by microcomputed tomography at the biopsy level and the mineral-to-matrix ratio was assessed by Raman spectroscopy at the ECM level. Both methods revealed that the degree of mineralization is higher for OI bone compared with healthy control. Micropillar compression is a novel technique for quantifying post-yield properties of bone at the ECM level. Micropillars (d = 5 $\mu$m, h = 10 $\mu$m) were fabricated using focused ion beam milling and quasi-statically compressed to capture key post-yield properties such as ultimate strength. The qualitative inspection of the stress–strain curves showed that both OI and healthy control bone have a ductile response at the ECM level. The quantitative results showed that compressive strength is not reduced in OI bone and is increasing with OI severity. Nanoindentation measurements revealed that OI bone tends to have a higher Young's modulus, hardness, and dissipated energy compared with healthy bone. Micropillar strength and indentation modulus increased linearly and significantly (p <.0001) with mineral-to-matrix ratio. In conclusion, this study indicates that compressive mechanical properties of dry OI bone at the iliac crest are not inferior to healthy control at the ECM level and increase with mineralization. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors.

abstract = {Motion artifacts are a common finding during high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) image acquisitions. To date it is not clear (i) when to repeat an acquisition, (ii) when to exclude a motion-degraded dataset post hoc, and (iii) how motion induced artifacts impact measures of trabecular and cortical parameters. In this study we present inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of a qualitative image quality grading score and report the prevalence of repeat acquisitions in our population. Finally the errors in bone density and micro-architectural parameters estimated from repeat acquisitions with and without motion degradation are presented. The relationship between these errors and the image quality grade is evaluated for each parameter. Repeat acquisitions performed due to operator-observed motion in the reconstructed image occurred for 22.7% of the exams (29.7% radius, 15.7% tibia). Of this subset, 88 exams with repeat acquisitions had at least one acquisition graded 1 (best quality). In this subset, the percent differences in bone density and micro-architecture measures tended to increase as the relative image quality decreased. Micro-architectural parameters were more sensitive to motion compared to geometric and densitometric parameters. These results provide estimates of the error in bone quality measures due to motion artifacts and provide an initial framework for developing standardized quality control criteria for cross-sectional and longitudinal HR-pQCT studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Fractures of the distal section of the radius (Colles' fractures) occur earlier in life than other osteoporotic fractures. Therefore, they can be interpreted as a warning signal for later, more deleterious fractures of vertebral bodies or the femoral neck. In the past decade, the advent of HR-pQCT allowed a detailed architectural analysis of the distal radius and an automated but time-consuming estimation of its strength with linear micro-finite element ($\mu$FE) analysis. Recently, a second generation of HR-pQCT scanner (XtremeCT II, SCANCO Medical, Switzerland) with a resolution beyond 61 $\mu$m became available for even more refined biomechanical investigations in vivo. This raises the question how biomechanical outcome variables compare between the original (LR) and the new (HR) scanner resolution. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to validate experimentally a patient-specific homogenized finite element (hFE) analysis of the distal section of the human radius for the fast prediction of Colles' fracture load based on the last generation HR-pQCT. Fourteen pairs of fresh frozen forearms (mean age = 77.5±9) were scanned intact using the high (61 $\mu$m) and the low (82 $\mu$m) resolution protocols that correspond to the new and original HR-pQCT systems. From each forearm, the 20 mm most distal section of the radius were dissected out, scanned with $\mu$CT at 16.4 $\mu$m and tested experimentally under compression up to failure for assessment of stiffness and ultimate load. Linear and nonlinear hFE models together with linear micro finite element ($\mu$FE) models were then generated based on the $\mu$CT and HR-pQCT reconstructions to predict the aforementioned mechanical properties of 24 sections. Precision errors of the short term reproducibility of the FE analyses were measured based on the repeated scans of 12 sections. The calculated failure loads correlated strongly with those measured in the experiments: accounting for donor as a random factor, the nonlinear hFE provided a marginal coefficient of determination (Rm2) of 0.957 for the high resolution (HR) and 0.948 for the low resolution (LR) protocols, the linear hFE with Rm2 of 0.957 for the HR and 0.947 for the LR protocols. Linear $\mu$FE predictions of the ultimate load were similar with an Rm2 of 0.950 for the HR and 0.954 for the LR protocols, respectively. Nonlinear hFE strength computation led to precision errors of 2.2 and 2.3% which were higher than the ones calculated based on the linear hFE (1.6 and 1.9%) and linear $\mu$FE (1.2 and 1.6%) for the HR and LR protocols respectively. Computation of the fracture load with nonlinear hFE demanded in average 6 h of CPU time which was 3 times faster than with linear $\mu$FE, while computation with linear hFE took only a few minutes. This study delivers an extensive experimental and numerical validation for the application of an accurate and fast hFE diagnostic tool to help in identifying individuals who may be at risk of an osteoporotic wrist fracture and to follow up pharmacological and other treatments in such patients.},

abstract = {Introduction
Individuals differ in forearm length. As microstructure differs along the radius, we hypothesized that errors may occur when sexual and racial dimorphisms are quantified at a fixed distance from the radio-carpal joint.
Methods
Microstructure was quantified ex vivo in 18 cadaveric radii using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and in vivo in 158 Asian and Caucasian women and men at a fixed region of interest (ROI), a corrected ROI positioned at 4.5–6% of forearm length and using the fixed ROI adjusted for cross sectional area (CSA), forearm length or height. Secular effects of age were assessed by comparing 38 younger and 33 older women.
Results
Ex vivo, similar amounts of bone mass fashioned adjacent cross sections. Larger distal cross sections had thinner porous cortices of lower matrix mineral density (MMD), a larger medullary CSA and higher trabecular density. Smaller proximal cross-sections had thicker less porous cortices of higher MMD, a small medullary canal with little trabecular bone. Taller persons had more distally positioned fixed ROIs which moved proximally when corrected. Shorter persons had more proximally positioned fixed ROIs which moved distally when corrected, so dimorphisms lessened. In the corrected ROIs, in Caucasians, women had 0.6 SD higher porosity and 0.6 SD lower trabecular density than men (p<0.01). In Asians, women had 0.25 SD higher porosity (NS) and 0.5 SD lower trabecular density than men (p<0.05). In women, Asians had 0.8 SD lower porosity and 0.3 SD higher trabecular density than Caucasians (p<0.01). In men, Asians and Caucasians had similar porosity and trabecular density. Results were similar using an adjusted fixed ROI. Adjusting for secular effects of age on forearm length resulted in the age-related increment in porosity increasing from 2.08 SD to 2.48 SD (p<0.05).
Conclusion
Assessment of sex, race and age related differences in microstructure requires measurement of anatomically equivalent regions.}

@article{Bonaretti2017,
abstract = {Summary: We investigated the sensitivity of distal bone density, structure, and strength measurements by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to variability in limb length. Our results demonstrate that HR-pQCT should be performed at a standard %-of-total-limb-length to avoid substantial measurement bias in population study comparisons and the evaluation of individual skeletal status in a clinical context. Introduction: High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) measures of bone do not account for anatomic variability in bone length: a 1-cm volume is acquired at a fixed offset from an anatomic landmark. Our goal was to evaluate HR-pQCT measurement variability introduced by imaging fixed vs. proportional volumes and to propose a standard protocol for relative anatomic positioning. Methods: Double-length (2-cm) scans were acquired in 30 adults. We compared measurements from 1-cm sub-volumes located at the default fixed offset, and the average %-of-length offset. The average position corresponded to 4.0% ± 1.1 mm for radius, and 7.2% ± 2.2 mm for tibia. We calculated the RMS difference in bone parameters and T-scores to determine the measurement variability related to differences in limb length. We used anthropometric ratios to estimate the mean limb length for published HR-pQCT reference data, and then calculated mean %-of-length offsets. Results: Variability between fixed vs. relative scan positions was highest in the radius, and for cortical bone in general (RMS difference Ct.Th = 19.5%), while individuals had T-score differentials as high as +3.0 SD (radius Ct.BMD). We estimated that average scan position for published HR-pQCT reference data corresponded to 4.0% at the radius, and 7.3% at tibia. Conclusion: Variability in limb length introduces significant bias to HR-pQCT measures, confounding cross-sectional analyses and limiting the clinical application for individual assessment of skeletal status. We propose to standardize scan positioning using 4.0 and 7.3% of total bone length for the distal radius and tibia, respectively.},

abstract = {We studied iliac crest biopsy cores taken from young individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta of several types, and from age-matched normals; the same samples had been used in prior studies using conventional light microscopic histomorphometric procedures. The PMMA blocks were micro-milled to a fine finish, carbon coated, and imaged using backscattered electrons (BSE) in an automated digital scanning electron microscope (SEM). For comparison of BSE signal levels between samples, microscope operation parameters were standardized by reference to halogenated dimethacrylate standards, and recording data from stereological arrays of 512*512 nonoverlapping pixels at 3.5 $\mu$m separation. All OI types showed higher average mineralization densities than age- and site-matched normals. This is interpreted as the result of the failure in matrix assembly, such that it has a higher water volume fraction available for mineral deposition. Added to the net deficit in bone quantity, the predicted higher stiffness of the more mineralized bone will account for much of the observed 'brittleness' that characterizes this class of genetic disease. The mean mineralization density, which was higher in types III, IV, and V than in type I, appears to be correlated with disease severity.},
